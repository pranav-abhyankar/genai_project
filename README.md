**📝 Text Completion Generator using Generative AI**

**Overview**

Text Completion Generator is a web-based NLP tool that uses a pre-trained Generative AI model (GPT-2) to generate coherent sentence completions based on user input. Built with the power of HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit, this project demonstrates the practical application of large language models for natural language understanding and generation.

Whether you're a developer, writer, or researcher, this tool can assist in writing suggestions, text continuation, and exploring generative text behaviors.

**🔍 Features**

- Takes a partial sentence or prompt as input

- Uses GPT-2 to generate a natural language continuation

- Interactive web UI built with Streamlit

- Configurable output with sampling and temperature control

- Simple, clean, and fast user experience

**🚀 Technologies Used**

- Python

- HuggingFace Transformers

- Pre-trained GPT-2 Model

- Streamlit


**🧠 How It Works?**

- The app loads a GPT-2 model using HuggingFace's pipeline("text-generation").

- The user enters the start of a sentence.

- On clicking the “Generate Completion” button, the model generates a continuation up to a specified max length.

- The output is displayed below the input box in real time.


**📈 Future Enhancements**

- Enable output ranking and multiple sentence suggestions

- Add grammar scoring or filtering options

- Integrate multilingual model support

- Fine-tune GPT-2 on domain-specific text (e.g., legal, medical)

- Add real-time collaborative editing or writing mode
